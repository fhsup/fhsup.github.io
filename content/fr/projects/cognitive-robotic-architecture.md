*Collaborative work with  Stéphane Thiery, Éric Nyiri and Olivier Gibaru*

This work led to a publication as a [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1145/3471985.3472385) at ICRCA 2021.


In recent years, industrial robots have become more collaborative thanks to better sensors and higher level programming libraries. Yet, in real world scenarios,
flexibility and interaction abilities of robots remains far from the natural interaction between two human co-workers. Thus, we are developing a smart robot agent (SRA)
that can incrementally learn with a human in a teacher/learner setting called Interactive Task Learning (ITL).

This video presents a high level overview and first prototype of this architecture for Industry 4.0.
It is validated on a real Universal robot (UR10e) : an operator teaches the robot the task "give object".
