**Hi, I am François Hélénon and in January 2022, I received my Ph.D. from HESAM University France prepared at Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology. Supervised by Prof. Olivier Gibaru, Dr. Stéphane Thiery and Dr. Éric Nyiri in [LISPEN laboratory](https://lispen.ensam.eu/), we designed a prototype of hybrid cognitive architecture for human interaction with industrial collaborative robots. The approach was based on the integration of symbolic (semantic graph representations) and connectionist (deep neural network learning) approaches and aimed allowing non-experts in robotics to teach new tasks to a robot.** 

**My interest lies in artificial intelligence within the human/robot collaboration scope, from learning to task planning under uncertainty.**
