This work led to a publication as a conference article at ICRCA 2021.
In recent years, industrial robots have become more collaborative thanks to better sensors and higher level programming libraries. Yet, in real world scenarios, flexibility and interaction abilities of robots remains far from the natural interaction between two human co-workers. Thus, we are developing a smart robot agent (SRA) that can incrementally learn with a human in a teacher/learner setting called Interactive Task Learning (ITL).</description></item></channel></rss>
