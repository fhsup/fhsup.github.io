In recent years, industrial robots have become more collaborative thanks to better sensors and higher level programming libraries. Yet, in real world scenarios, flexibility and interaction abilities of robots remains far from the natural interaction between two human co-workers. Thus, we are developing a smart robot agent (SRA) that can incrementally learn with a human in a teacher/learner setting called Interactive Task Learning (ITL).</description></item><item><title>Learning grasping from authorised and prohibited demonstrations</title><link>https://fhsup.github.io/fr/projects/learning-grasping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fhsup.github.io/fr/projects/learning-grasping/</guid><description>Work jointly done with Laurent Bimont, Stéphane Thiery, Éric Nyiri and Olivier Gibaru
This work led to a publication as a conference article at RO-MAN 2020.
Our motivation is to ease robots’ reconfiguration for pick and place tasks in an industrial context. We propose a fast learner neural network model trained from one or a few demonstrations in less than 5 minutes, able to efficiently predict grasping locations on a specific object.</description></item><item><title>Learning synergies between grasping and pushing in an autonomous way</title><link>https://fhsup.github.io/fr/projects/learning-synergies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fhsup.github.io/fr/projects/learning-synergies/</guid><description>Work jointly done with Laurent Bimont, Stéphane Thiery, Éric Nyiri and Olivier Gibaru
The bin picking use case is a typical example of action where it can be hard to explain procedurally how to carry it out. Actually, explaining in a procedural manner how to carry out such a task is hard even for a human. We could hardly explicit why we would spread a heap of object in one way rather than in another way.</description></item></channel></rss>
